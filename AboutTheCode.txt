Hi,

First let me thank you for giving me the opportunity. I enjoyed coding in Node.js and the problem was interesting to do.

I have completed the tasks except for number 4. 
I could not correctly detect when a point is inside a region on App B. 
My idea was to check for each point whether it is in the rectangle area or not by comparing the co-ordinates. 
My idea was to set each rectangle a random color then to indicate if a point is inside a rectangle it will transform the color to white.
But It did not work as intended.
I also tried simulating mouse events using event.dispatch but was unsuccesfull in my attempt. 
In any case, I have calculated the current and average speed of the mouse movements.

I added an extra replay button alongside "Request a Replay" button. 
"Request a Replay" - button fetches data from server and draw the points 10 times faster
"Replay Just From This App" - button only replay the points that were drawn on that particular instance of App B.

In any case, thank you again.

Below is some server config information:

1. To install the dependencies:
	
	npm install
	
	
	
2. To start the server:

	node server.js
	

3. This will start the server at port 3000.

4. For App A: localhost:3000/app1
5. For App B: localhost:300/app2

Thanks again.
